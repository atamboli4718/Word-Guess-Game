/*
flows to do:

checking guess against computer guess:
-if guess is not part of keysToPress, alert "opps..." and resume game.
-if guess is part of already guess var aler user "looks like you have already used this letter!" resume game. (create a correctGuess var)
-if the guess is a part of of keys to press, compare the guess to the computerSelection. 
    if guess is a subset of computerSelection and is not in already guessed, take one off remaining guesses and log it in the current word. AND
        mark that letter as part of the already guessed letters
-if inin = 10, alert "Looks like you've reached limit of incorrect guesses, computer wins!", reveal computer guess and end game

once remainingLetters goes to zero alert "Game over! Time to brush up on some 90's hits. Press ok to play again" rerun rungame function upon click
once correctGuess var = computerSelection alert "Nice job! Press ok to play again" rerun rungame function
- xxx denotes actions for later


- Need to know how to place correct guesses in the blanks on the HTML file in the correct place.
- adding all this to the HTML file.... I think it's document.getElementBYID("idexample").innerText=...






// helpful for later: 
// var res = str.toLowerCase(); 
// document.getElementById("game").innerText=whoWins
// while (remaingLetters > 0) {
    //gamecode here
    //show the input from the player
    //update answers array and remainingLetters for every correct guess
// }
